# SafePaws Shelters

Open DIY blueprints for insulated outdoor shelters that help stray cats survive the winter.

---

## 💛 What is SafePaws?

SafePaws Shelters is an open, non-commercial project that gives anyone free plans to build warm, safe outdoor shelters for stray cats.  
The idea is simple: we share the designs, you build the shelter, and together we make winters less dangerous for animals living on the streets.

You don’t need to be an engineer or a maker. If you can order a laser-cut plywood sheet and follow a step-by-step guide, you can build a SafePaws shelter.

## 🏠 Shelter Models

The system currently includes two main DIY models:

- **Cozy** – compact shelter for **1–2 cats**  
- **Family** – larger shelter for **up to 4–5 cats**

All models are designed for cold climates and share the same core principles:

- **Double walls with insulation gap** – a fixed 40 mm cavity for textile-based insulation keeps the inside warm.
- **L-shaped entrance** – blocks wind and splashes, helps keep snow and rain out.
- **Raised base** – protects the floor from ground moisture.
- **Laser-cut plywood construction** – all parts are designed to be cut on common laser machines and slot together with interlocking joints.
- **Quick assembly** – a shelter can be assembled in about 1–2 hours on the first try; much faster once you know the process.

> In thermal tests with two cats inside and a 40 mm insulation layer, the Cozy model keeps the interior noticeably warmer than the outside winter air when properly insulated and sealed.

## 🔧 Materials & Tools

SafePaws shelters are optimized for **affordable fabrication** and **simple assembly**:

**Main materials**

- 3 mm birch plywood sheets (for laser cutting)
- Textile-based insulation (old cotton fabric, clothes, paper, etc. – dry and clean)
- Wood glue (PVA or similar)
- Weather-resistant wood finish or sealant (animal-safe)
- Stainless steel or ceramic bowls (for food and water, optional)

**Basic tools**

- Rubber mallet or hammer with a wooden block
- Brush for glue and sealant
- Sandpaper (around P80–P120)
- Optional: clamps, protective gloves, simple hand tools

## 📂 What’s in this repository?

This repo contains everything you need to start:

- **Laser-cutting files** for Cozy and Family shelters (in vector formats suitable for laser cutters)
- **Assembly instructions** in English and Russian with step-by-step guidance and diagrams
- **Technical notes & release docs** describing design decisions and updates (for example, the transition to 3 mm plywood while keeping a 40 mm insulation gap)
- **Project and community links** (website, Open Collective, social media)

## 🚀 How to Build a Shelter (Quick Overview)

For full instructions and diagrams, see the assembly manual in this repo and on the website.

1. **Download the files**
   - Choose a model (Cozy or Family).
   - Download the corresponding laser-cutting files from the repo or the Releases page.

2. **Cut the parts**
   - Send the files to a local laser-cutting workshop, makerspace, or fab lab.
   - Ask them to cut from 3 mm plywood sheets.

3. **Prepare the parts**
   - Lightly sand sharp edges and corners.
   - Treat outer surfaces and edges with a weather-resistant, animal-safe wood finish.
   - Lay out the parts in numerical order (each piece is numbered in the design).

4. **Assemble the body**
   - Start from the base and legs.
   - Add inner and outer walls using the interlocking joints.
   - Glue all critical joints for strength and airtightness.
   - Keep one access side or the roof open for now.

5. **Add insulation**
   - Fill the 40 mm gap between the double walls with dry textile-based insulation (crumpled paper, cotton rags, fabric offcuts).
   - Do not over-compress the insulation; it should be fluffy to trap air.

6. **Close and finish**
   - Install the remaining wall or roof panel.
   - Add feeding bowl holders if your chosen model includes them.
   - Check all joints, add extra glue where needed.
   - Let everything dry and cure.

7. **Place the shelter outside**
   - Choose a quiet, hidden place away from roads and dogs.
   - Orient the entrance away from the prevailing wind.
   - If possible, raise the shelter slightly above the ground (bricks, wooden blocks) to avoid standing water.

## ✅ Placement & Safety Tips

- **Location:** quiet courtyard corners, under sheds, behind garages, near places where cats already sleep or get food.
- **Respect people and rules:** avoid blocking paths, entrances, or emergency access. If needed, first talk to neighbours or building management.
- **Maintenance:** check the shelter from time to time, refresh bedding, and repair any damage.
- **Camouflage:** neutral colours help the shelter blend into the environment and avoid unwanted attention.

## 🤝 How to Get Involved

You can help even if you never touch a laser cutter:

- **Build a shelter** for cats in your yard, neighbourhood, or near a known feeding spot.
- **Share your results** – post photos, write about your experience, and tag the project on social media (for example, Instagram [`@safepaws.home`](https://www.instagram.com/safepaws.home/)).
- **Contribute to the project**:
  - Improve documentation or translations
  - Help with new layouts or formats for other sheet sizes
  - Provide feedback from real-world use
- **Support financially** via Open Collective:  
  https://opencollective.com/safepawsorganization

Every shelter built is a real, practical difference for animals that have nowhere else to go.
