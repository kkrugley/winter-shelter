# About

Every winter is a harsh challenge for stray cats: cold, wind, hunger, and danger. I realized that technology and human compassion could change this. This is how the _SafePaws Shelters_ project was born — an open initiative that turns the idea of help into simple, accessible actions.

My goal is to give everyone the chance to save a life. To achieve this, I designed two types of all-season outdoor shelters: the compact "Cozy" for 1-2 cats and the spacious "Family" for 4-5 cats. Their double-walled construction with an L-shaped vestibule protects against cold and predators, while eco-friendly materials (plywood, fabric scraps) ensure the shelters are safe and durable.

Most importantly, the project is **free**. I’ve openly shared all laser-cut files, bilingual instructions (English/Russian), and assembly tips. Now, anyone with access to a laser cutter can create a shelter in just hours. This isn’t just DIY — it’s a way to unite families, schools, and workshops around the shared mission of caring for animals.
