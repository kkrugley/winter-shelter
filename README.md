# About

Welcome to **SafePaws Shelters** – an open, friendly, and impactful project dedicated to saving the lives of stray cats through easy, sustainable, and affordable DIY shelters! If you're an animal lover or a maker, you're in the right place.

## 🌱 Key Ideas

- **Mission:** Protecting stray cats from harsh winters with affordable, easy-to-make, and eco-friendly shelters.
- **Open & Free:** All files, instructions, and tips are openly shared so anyone can build a shelter – in schools, families, workshops, or communities.
- **Empowering Action:** The project is about more than building shelters. It’s about uniting people around compassion for animals and making real change with your own hands.
- **Design Integrity:** The shelters' unique designs and intellectual property rights are registered by the author using a digital token.

## 🏠 Shelter Models

We’ve designed two main DIY shelter types:

- **Cozy:** Compact, fits 1-2 cats (70×50×80cm).
- **Family:** Spacious, fits 4-5 cats (130×95×70cm).

**Both models feature:**
- Double-wall construction with insulation for winter warmth.
- L-shaped vestibule to block wind and keep predators out.
- Made from eco-friendly plywood (6mm) and recycled materials for insulation (fabric scraps, crumpled paper).
- Optimized for common laser-cutter sheet sizes: 750×750mm, 1300×900mm, etc.
- All parts are pre-numbered and ready to assemble.

## 🛠 Technical Overview

- **Materials:** 6mm plywood, recycled insulation, PVA glue, rubber mallet, sandpaper, waterproof wood sealant.
- **Construction:** 
  - Durable double walls.
  - Removable roof with slope for water runoff.
  - Modular build – easy to transport and assemble.
  - Laser-cut for precision and easy replication.
- **Assembly Time:** Usually a few hours for a single shelter.

# 📝 Instructions: How To Build

Here's a quick step-by-step guide! For detailed diagrams and bilingual guides (EN/RU), see the manual included in this repository.

## 1. Preparation

- Gather your tools: rubber mallet, PVA glue, sandpaper, brush, waterproof wood sealant.
- Treat all plywood parts with sealant for weather protection.
- Check that all parts are engraved with numbers for easier navigation.

## 2. Assembly

- Start by connecting numbered parts for the base and support legs using glue and the mallet (see diagrams).
- Assemble internal and external walls as indicated.
- For multi-part elements, use glue on all joints for stability.
- Fill the space between walls with crumpled paper or old fabric for extra insulation.
- Mount the roof, ensuring the slope is facing outwards for proper drainage.
- Attach the stainless steel bowl holders (max 12cm diameter bowl, wide rim).
- Secure bowls with waterproof adhesive to prevent theft.

## 3. Finishing Touches

- Place the project info panel on the roof (template included).
- Double-check all joints and add extra glue as needed.
- Your shelter is ready! Find a safe, secluded spot protected from wind, not too close to passing people.

## 4. Assembly Tips

- If parts are tight, lightly tap with the mallet or sand rough joints.
- Always refer to the included diagrams — they make life easier.
- Join our community and share your shelter photos and improvements!

# 💡 Project Roadmap

We’re actively improving!
